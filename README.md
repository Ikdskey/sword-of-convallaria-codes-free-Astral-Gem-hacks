Sword of Convallaria codes for 500K Astral Gem Hacks mod menu - On the character screen, you can see this option through the "Break Limit" button below the "Enhance" button. Breaking the limit itself does not increase the character's attributes, but it increases the unit's level limit by 5 and can be completed up to 4 times. Breaking through limits requires evolution crystals, and these resources are difficult to obtain. Every time you search for more units and double them, each repetition will automatically transform into an evolutionary crystal of its own element. There is also a universal 'omnipotent evolution crystal', but this rare resource can only be obtained from difficult event tasks.
